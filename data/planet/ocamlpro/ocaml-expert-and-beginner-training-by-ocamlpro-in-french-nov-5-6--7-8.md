<p>In our endeavour to encourage professional programmers to understand and use OCaml, OCamlPro will be giving two training sessions, in French, in our Paris offices:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ocamlpro.com/course-ocaml-development/">OCaml Beginner course</a> for professional programmers (5-6 Nov)
</li>
<li><a href="https://ocamlpro.com/course-ocaml-expert/">OCaml Expertise</a> (7-8 Nov).
</li>
</ul>
<p>The "Expert" OCaml course is for already experienced OCaml programmers to better understand advanced type system possibilities (objects, GADTs), discover GC internals, write "compiler-optimizable" code.</p>
<p>These sessions are also an opportunity to come discuss with OCamlPro's OPAM &amp; Flambda lead developers and core contributors in Paris.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Training in English can also be organized, on-demand.</p>
