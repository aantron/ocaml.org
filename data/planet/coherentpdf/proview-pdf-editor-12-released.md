<p>The new version of the <a href="http://www.coherentpdf.com/proview.html">Proview PDF Editor</a> for Mac OS X is now available for download. The update is free for existing users – your license key will still work – just download and install from the website.</p>
<p>New features include Visual Crop and the setting of crop and trim boxes on individual pages. It’s also about twice as fast as before.</p>
