<p>The 17th beta of jbuilder represents a few months of development. While that’s a
bit longer than our usual release cycle for these betas, we do have a larger
release than usual. So I’ve decided to write up a little post in addition to
just posting the usual change log. I’ll talk about some important new features,
and some less important ones as well. A couple of things that I’ll omit are bug
fixes and experimental features as this blog post is already long.</p>
