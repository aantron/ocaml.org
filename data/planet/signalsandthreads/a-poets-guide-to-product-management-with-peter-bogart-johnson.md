<p>Peter Bogart-Johnson was one of Jane Street’s first program managers, and helped bring the art of PMing—where that “P” variously stands for “project,” “product,” or some blend of the two—to the company at large. He’s also a poet and the editor of a literary magazine. In this episode, Peter and Ron discuss the challenge of gaining trust as an outsider: how do you teach teams a new way of doing things while preserving what’s already working? The key, Peter says, is you listen; a good PM is an anthropologist. They also discuss how paying down technical debt isn’t something you do instead of serving customers; what Jane Street looks for in PM candidates; and how to help teams coordinate in times of great change.</p><p>You can find the transcript for this episode &nbsp;on our <a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/a-poets-guide-to-product-management" target="_blank">website.</a></p><p>Some links to topics that came up in the discussion:</p><ul><li><a href="https://lit-magazine.blogspot.com/">LIT Magazine</a> (more recently <a href="https://www.litmagazine.org/">here</a>)</li><li><a href="https://staysaasy.com/product/2023/03/12/pm-engineers-dont-hate.html">How to be a PM that engineers don’t hate</a> and <a href="https://staysaasy.com/engineering/2023/06/18/how-to-be-an-engineer-pms-down-hate.html">How to be an engineer that PMs don’t hate</a></li></ul>
