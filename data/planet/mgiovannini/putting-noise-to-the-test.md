So how do you use Perlin's Simplex Noise? By using the GIF encoder, of course! I generated the test image shown in the last post:

with a minimal application of both modules in test.ml (source code follows). For a visually richer but not much more complicated example, I also tried replicating Iñigo Quílez's turbulent textures in fbm.ml. The animation traces a tiny loop in noise
