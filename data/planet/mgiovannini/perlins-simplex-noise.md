Graphics pioneer Ken Perlin is well-known for his work on procedural generation of textures. Recently he rewrote his classic Noise algorithm to reduce the complexity of generating pseudorandom gradients in higher dimensions by transforming a problem on N-cells to one on N-simplices. I couldn't find on his NYU home page a write-up by his own hand; apparently the only implementation exists in his
