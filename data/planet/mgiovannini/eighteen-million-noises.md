Update: Here is the PNGPack source-code archive:
Per second. Yes, it's benchmark time. I pitted Prof. Perlin's original implementation against Stefan Gustavson's, and the results are in! I ran two sets of benchmarks, one in Java and the other in OCaml. In both cases I compared three versions of Simplex Noise: Perlin's pipelined 3D Noise, and Gustavson's 2D Noise and 3D Noise:
noisep: Perlin's 3D
